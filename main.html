	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>The Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. efficient Time complexity is the measure of how an algorithm's execution time grows with respect to the size of its input data.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to run to completion.O(n) Linear Space The algorithmâ€™s memory usage grows linearly with the input size.</p>
